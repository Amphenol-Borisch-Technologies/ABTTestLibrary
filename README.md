# TestLibrary is a simple functional test sequencing library for sibling project TestProgram:
  National Instruments™ TestStand™ & Keysight Technologies™ OpenTAP™ are test sequencers; so are TestLibrary/Test/Program, except vastly simpler.
  
  Sibling project TestProgram is both a demonstration program and a functional test of TestLibrary.
  
  Sibling project TestLibraryTests are basic MSTest unit tests of TestLibrary.
