# TestLibrary is a simple functional test sequencing library:
  Think National Instruments' TestStand™, or Keysight Technologies' OpenTAP™, except vastly simpler.
  
  Sibling project TestProgram is both a demonstration program and a functional test of TestLibrary.
  
  Sibling project TestLibraryTests are basic MSTest unit tests of TestLibrary.
