# TestLibrary is a simple functional test sequencer:
  # Think National Instruments' TestStand, or Keysight Technologies' OpenTAP, except vastly simpler.
  # Sibling project TestProgram is both a demonstration program and a functional test of TestLibrary.
  # Sibling project TestLibraryTests are basic MSTest unit tests of TestLibrary.
